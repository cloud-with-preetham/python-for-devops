# DevOps Automation API – Capstone Project

## Project Overview

A FastAPI-based REST API that automates DevOps tasks including log analysis and AWS EC2 monitoring.

---

## S.T.A.R Explanation

### S – Situation

- Manual log analysis was time-consuming and error-prone
- Checking AWS EC2 instances required logging into console repeatedly
- No centralized way to access DevOps operational data

### T – Task

- Automate log parsing to quickly identify INFO and WARN level messages
- Create an API to fetch AWS EC2 instance details programmatically
- Build a reusable service that can be integrated into monitoring workflows

### A – Action

- Built a FastAPI application with three core endpoints
- Implemented log analyzer using Python file handling and Counter
- Integrated AWS Boto3 to fetch EC2 instance summaries
- Added health check endpoint for service monitoring
- Created interactive API documentation using FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI

### R – Result

- Reduced log analysis time from manual inspection to instant API calls
- Enabled programmatic access to AWS resources without console login
- Created a scalable foundation for adding more DevOps automation endpoints
- Delivered a production-ready API with auto-generated documentation

## Technical Implementation

### Endpoints Built

1. `/health` - Service health monitoring
2. `/logs` - Automated log analysis (INFO/WARN counts)
3. `/aws` - EC2 instance summary (ID, Type, State)
4. `/docs` - Interactive API documentation

### Tech Stack

- **Python 3.13+** - Core language
- **FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework
- **Boto3** - AWS SDK for Python
- **Uvicorn** - ASGI server

### Key Features

- RESTful API design
- AWS cloud integration
- Log parsing automation
- Auto-generated documentation

## DevOps Thinking Applied

This project demonstrates:

- **Automation** - Replaced manual tasks with API calls
- **Reliability** - Health checks and structured responses
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new endpoints
- **Integration** - Can be consumed by other tools/services

---

## What I Learned

- How to build production-ready APIs with FastAPI
- AWS automation using Boto3
- Log parsing and analysis techniques
- DevOps mindset: automate repetitive tasks
- How to structure code for maintainability

---

## Next Steps

- Add authentication for production use
- Implement error handling and logging
- Add more AWS services (S3, Lambda, CloudWatch)
- Create CLI wrapper for the API
- Add unit tests and CI/CD pipeline
